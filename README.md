# Hello, there!
I am Shashwat Suthar! I am interested in computer graphics and physics engines and am an open-source enthusiast, I am a part of the [Arch Package Testing team](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Arch_Testing_Team). I am always on the lookout for new projects to work on and new people to collaborate with. Do check out my repositories and feel free to reach out if you would like to work on any of my existing projects or if you think that I would be a good fit in your project.
